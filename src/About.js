                    At the age of 26 I left what could end up to be the most stable employment 
                    experience I will ever have as a union-backed employee of the Commonwealth of 
                    Pennsylvania to try to learn how to code. After two years of toiling away in 
                    the basement of the State Treasury building I was ready for a change. When 
                    preparing to leave any position it's important to have a plan - which I think 
                    ideally would include a start date for a new position, however as I was 
                    preparing for my own departure I would frequently find that I was missing 
                    skills for the jobs that I wanted, and didn't have much interest in the jobs 
                    for which I was qualified.

                    I had long held an interest in coding, but aside from completing a few random 
                    tutorials here and there, I hadn’t really done much about it. However at that 
                    big moment in my life I made a decision: instead of immediately seeking another 
                    position, I elected to pursue that long-held interest in coding by completing 
                    an intensive program to learn computer programming.

                    So far, the thing that I have enjoyed the most is building websites using 
                    React.js. Sometimes things never make it past the localhost phase, but 
                    nonetheless, I’ve greatly enjoyed being able to take an idea, and quickly 
                    get it working in the browser.

                    There’s a saying that goes “The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. 
                    The second best time is now.” It’s a line that resonates with me as I think it 
                    relates to my journey as a coder. Although I wish that I could go back in time 
                    and tell my childhood self to start coding, I cannot. So I do the next best 
                    thing by learning and practicing as much as I can. I’m just getting started, 
                    but I’ve loved every minute of it, and can’t wait to see where coding may take 
                    me.
